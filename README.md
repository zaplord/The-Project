# The-Project
So i am here to reflect on my progress so far, I can start by what date i made this README.md file which is at 13:15 December the 29th 2024
I have not learned to much, its because I knew a lot of the stuff before hand but it was a good reflection on the things i might have forgotten.
Never mind actually, I did learn that in programming teamwork is essential as it is in real life, But for now i have to code a website.
